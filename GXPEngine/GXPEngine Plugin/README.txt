This folder includes all the addons for the GXPEngine with features you couldn't access before.
To access the addons place the plugin folder next to the GXPEngine folder and the other .cs files.
When using the files please use for example AnimationSpriteAddOn instead of AnimationSprite in your classes. 
This will give you all the features of the animation sprite + the add-on.

Keep in mind that it might be updated in the future as more requested features will be added.
For now please enjoy and let me know any other features that you want to see that GXPEngine didn't include.
